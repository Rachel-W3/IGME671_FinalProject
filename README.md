# Texas Cold Front Sound Design

[Final Project Repository for IGME 671 - Interactive Games and Audio]

I created a 2D pixel-art game with three other game design students that essentially simulates the struggles of Texans after the snow storm. The goal of our project was to get players to empathize and get a better idea of how harsh and catastrophic the whole experience was for people whoâ€™ve never experienced snow storms. We wanted to convey how fatal the domino effect was on everyone caught in the storm, but since we only had five weeks to develop this piece, we simulated the experience with minigames for survival tasks (maintaining food, keeping water supply by melting snow, maintaining warmth, etc.) and a bit of dialogue between members of the family that is the main focus of the game. 

This is intended to be a serious and solemn game, so I wish to further convey that by adding a lot of whitenoise ambience (wind howling, leaves rattling in the distance) and sound effects for everyday at-home interactions (footsteps, water boiling). The main source of heat is a controlled fire in the living room, so there will also be a crackling fire sound.
